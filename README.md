# Bioinformatics

Something about me: I majored in Public Health - Epidemiology and have been interested in Biostats or Data Analysis in general. Due to my shift in PhD topic, I will have to handle genetic data.  Therefore, this repsosite is dedicated to my bioinformatics learning journey. 

Thank you!
